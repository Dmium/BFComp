+
add one to current value in tape

-
subtract one from current value in tape

>
inciment position in tape

<
decriment position in tape

[
jump to matching ] if current position in tape is 0

]
jump to matching [ if current position in tape is not 0

.
output current position in tape to output buffer

,
take from input (and wait for further input?


Registers
Name				bits	description
Instruction Pointer		8-12	Points to instruction in instruction  RAM
Current Instruction Register	3	Contains currently executing command
Instruction Change Register	2	0(no change) 1(+1) 2(-1) 3(?) change at the end of a cycle
Alternate instruction register	1	Basically the 4th bit on instruction register
Tape Pointer			8-12	Points to current tape position in tape RAM
Current Tape Register		8	Contains the number at the current position in the tape
Tape Change Register		2	0(no change) 1(+1) 2(-1) 3(?) change at the end of a cycle



instruction execution
1.
Load instruction at address in program Instruction Pointer  from RAM into Current Instruction Register
2.
(Simultaneously?) load current position in tape at address in Tape Pointer into Current Tape Register
3.
Activate correct board
4.
Allow clock to ALU
4.
Execute instruction
6.
Most likely
	Store result of instruction on Tape Register
	Store contents of Tape Register in tape at current tape 
Possibly
	Store result of instruction directly in Tape 
7.
Incriment Instruction Pointer by Content of Instruction change register(using ALU's + function?)
Incriment Tape Pointer by content of Tape change register(using ALU's + function?)

ALU board notes

Per module:
Either take 3 bits to confirm activation or select board using clock
Take 8 bits from current tape register
Output
